# The Wired

The Wired is an open protocol for the metaverse.
It is a collection of open standards focused on interactive 3D environments,
self-sovereign identity, and seamless interoperability.

## Protocol

- [Social](./social)
- [Spatial](./spatial)

## Motivation

Today's VR ecosystem is fragmented by proprietary platforms that confine users and developers to isolated, controlled environments.
Each platform enforces its own set of rules and restrictions, often under leadership
that makes arbitrary decisions with no recourse for the people who live within the virtual spaces they govern.

With VR our digital rights matter more than ever.
The Wired acknowledges this importance by fostering a decentralized environment where anyone
can contribute and shape the future of the metaverse.

By embracing open source principles, The Wired doesn't just safeguard against abuse;
it unleashes a wave of creativity and collaboration not possible within walled gardens.
