# The Wired

The Wired is an open protocol for the metaverse. It is a collection of open
standards focused on interactive 3D environments, self-sovereign identity, and
seamless interoperability.

## Protocol

- [Social](./social)
- [Spatial](./spatial)

## Motivation

Today's VR ecosystem is fragmented by proprietary platforms that confine users
and developers to isolated, controlled environments. Each platform enforces its
own set of rules and restrictions, often under leadership that makes arbitrary
decisions with no recourse for the people who live within the virtual spaces
they govern[^1].

With VR our digital rights matter more than ever. The Wired acknowledges this
importance by fostering a decentralized environment where anyone can contribute
and shape the future of the metaverse.

By embracing open source principles, The Wired doesn't just safeguard against
abuse; it unleashes a wave of creativity and collaboration not possible within
walled gardens.
